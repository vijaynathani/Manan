	<ol>
		<li>Use the right-hand thumb to move the lower beads up to the bar and the right-hand index finger to move the lower beads away from the bar. The upper bead is moved bidirectionally by the index finger.</li>
		<li>For direct addition, move towards the bar. For direct subtraction, move away from the bar.</li>
		<li>When direct addition/subtraction is unfeasible, use 5's complement to move beads down/up, respectively. (1,4) and (2,3) are 5's complement groups. <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
			<li>+1 = +5 -4  and  -1 = -5 +4</li>
			<li>+2 = +5 -3  and  -2 = -5 +3</li>
			<li>+3 = +5 -2  and  -3 = -5 +2</li>
			<li>+4 = +5 -1  and  -4 = -5 +1</li></ul></li>
		<li>When 5's complement is  unfeasible, use 10's complement. (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), and (5,5) are 10's complement groups.
		<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
		    <li>+1= +10 -9  and  -1 = -10 +9</li>
    		<li>+2= +10 -8  and  -2 = -10 +8</li>
    		<li>+3= +10 -7  and  -3 = -10 +7</li>
    		<li>+4= +10 -6  and  -4 = -10 +6</li>
    		<li>+5= +10 -5  and  -5 = -10 +5</li>
    		<li>+6= +10 -4  and  -6 = -10 +4</li>
    		<li>+7= +10 -3  and  -7 = -10 +3</li>
    		<li>+8= +10 -2  and  -8 = -10 +2</li>
    		<li>+9= +10 -1  and  -9 = -10 +1</li></ul></li>
